            <p>If you have a dispute with us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@liftaway.app">support@liftaway.app</a> to attempt to resolve it informally before pursuing formal action.</p>

            <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <div class="important-box">
                <p><strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and LiftAway agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify</li>
                <li>Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Arbitration Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules</li>
                <li>The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding</li>
                <li>Arbitration will take place in Sheridan, Wyoming</li>
                <li>Each party will bear its own costs and attorneys' fees</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong></p>
            <p>You agree that disputes will be resolved on an individual basis. You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>
